                <br>
        Once there was a tree....<br>
        and she loved a little boy.<br>
        And everyday the boy would come<br>
        and he would gather her leaves<br>
        and make them into crowns<br>
        and play king of the forest.<br>
        He would climb up her trunk<br>
        and swing from her branches<br>
        and eat apples.<br>
        And they would play hide-and-go-seek.<br>
        And when he was tired,<br>
        he would sleep in her shade.<br>
        And the boy loved the tree....<br>
        very much.<br>
        And the tree was happy.<br>
        But time went by.<br>
        And the boy grew older.<br>
        And the tree was often alone.<br>
        Then one day the boy came to the tree<br>
        and the tree said, "Come, Boy, come and<br>
        climb up my trunk and swing from my<br>
        branches and eat apples and play in my<br>
        shade and be happy."<br>
        "I am too big to climb and play" said<br>
        the boy.<br>
        "I want to buy things and have fun.<br>
        I want some money?"<br>
        "I'm sorry," said the tree, "but I<br>
        have no money.<br>
        I have only leaves and apples.<br>
        Take my apples, Boy, and sell them in<br>
        the city. Then you will have money and<br>
        you will be happy."<br>
        And so the boy climbed up the<br>
        tree and gathered her apples<br>
        and carried them away.<br>
        And the tree was happy.<br>
        But the boy stayed away for a long time....<br>
        and the tree was sad.<br>
        And then one day the boy came back<br>
        and the tree shook with joy<br>
        and she said, "Come, Boy, climb up my trunk<br>
        and swing from my branches and be happy."<br>
        "I am too busy to climb trees," said the boy.<br>
        "I want a house to keep me warm," he said.<br>
        "I want a wife and I want children,<br>
        and so I need a house.<br>
        Can you give me a house ?"<br>
        " I have no house," said the tree.<br>
        "The forest is my house,<br>
        but you may cut off<br>
        my branches and build a<br>
        house. Then you will be happy."<br>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        And so the boy cut off her branches<br>
        and carried them away<br>
        to build his house.<br>
        And the tree was happy.<br>
        But the boy stayed away for a long time.<br>
        And when he came back,<br>
        the tree was so happy<br>
        she could hardly speak.<br>
        "Come, Boy," she whispered,<br>
        "come and play."<br>
        "I am too old and sad to play,"<br>
        said the boy.<br>
        "I want a boat that will<br>
        take me far away from here.<br>
        Can you give me a boat?"<br>
        "Cut down my trunk<br>
        and make a boat," said the tree.<br>
        "Then you can sail away...<br>
        and be happy."<br>
        And so the boy cut down her trunk<br>
        and made a boat and sailed away.<br>
        And the tree was happy<br>
        ... but not really.<br>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        And after a long time<br>
        the boy came back again.<br>
        "I am sorry, Boy,"<br>
        said the tree," but I have nothing<br>
        left to give you -<br>
        My apples are gone."<br>
        "My teeth are too weak<br>
        for apples," said the boy.<br>
        "My branches are gone,"<br>
        said the tree. " You<br>
        cannot swing on them - "<br>
        "I am too old to swing<br>
        on branches," said the boy.<br>
        "My trunk is gone, " said the tree.<br>
        "You cannot climb - "<br>
        "I am too tired to climb" said the boy.<br>
        "I am sorry," sighed the tree.<br>
        "I wish that I could give you something....<br>
        but I have nothing left.<br>
        I am just an old stump.<br>
        I am sorry...."<br>
        "I don't need very much now," said the boy.<br>
        "just a quiet place to sit and rest.<br>
        I am very tired."<br>
        "Well," said the tree, straightening<br>
        herself up as much as she could,<br>
        "well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting<br>
        Come, Boy, sit down. Sit down and rest."<br>
        And the boy did.<br>
        And the tree was happy.<br>
